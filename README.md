# Optimizing Stock Return Predictions Using Network Centrality Measures Based on Maximized Lagged Correlations
This project aims to optimize stock return predictions by leveraging network centrality measures based on maximized lagged correlations between stocks.

##  Project Summary

- **Timeframe**: January 1, 2019 – January 1, 2024  
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance  
- **Assets Analyzed**: Top 50 NYSE stocks by trading volume  
- **Target**: Weekly stock returns  
- **Key Methods**:  
  - Lagged correlation analysis  
  - Network construction with edge weights based on max correlation  
  - Centrality feature engineering  
  - Predictive modeling with LSTM and Linear Regression


## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Fetched daily prices for 5 years using `yfinance`
- Filtered to top 50 stocks by average volume
- Converted daily returns into **weekly returns** (Thursday-to-Wednesday)

### 2. Lagged Correlation Analysis
- Computed pairwise correlations for lags from -4 to +4 weeks
- Selected the **maximum correlation** and corresponding **lag** per pair
- Calculated **p-values** for statistical significance

### 3. Network Construction
- Created **directed and undirected graphs** using NetworkX
- Nodes: Stocks  
- Edges: Correlation strength  
  - Directed if lag ≠ 0  
  - Undirected if lag = 0  
- Filtered by correlation threshold (≥ 0.8) and p-value (≤ 0.05)

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Computed centrality measures for each stock:
  - **PageRank**
  - **Betweenness**
  - **Closeness**
  - **Eigenvector**
- Analyzed trends and statistical correlations with returns
- Normalized features for modeling

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Developed two LSTM models:
  - With centrality measures (exogenous variables)
  - Without centrality measures (autoregressive baseline)
- Benchmarked against Linear Regression models
- Evaluated with:
  - **SMAPE** (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
  - **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error)
 
## Results Snapshot

| Model                   | SMAPE (%) | RMSE   |
|------------------------|-----------|--------|
| LSTM w/ Centrality     | 11.35     | 28.26  |
| LSTM w/o Centrality    | 11.66     | 28.99  |
| Linear Regression w/ C | 41.70     | 77.08  |
| Linear Regression w/o C| 11.55     | 30.77  |

✅ LSTM benefited from centrality features  
❌ Linear Regression failed with complex (nonlinear) inputs
